# ü¶Ä Crab: Cross-platform Agent Benchmark for Multimodal Embodied Language Model Agents

## Overview

Crab is a framework for building LLM agent benchmark environments in a Python-centric way.

#### Key Features

* üåê Cross-platform
  * Build agent environments in memory, hosted through a docker environment, installed a virtual machine, or as a distributed physical machine, as long as they can be accessed by Python functions.
  * Let the agent access all the environments in the same time through a unified interface.
* ‚öô Ô∏èEasy-to-use Configuration
  * Add a new action by simply adding a `@action` decorator on a Python function.
  * Deine the environment by integrating several actions together.
* üìê Novel Benchmarking Suite
  * Define tasks and the corresponding evlauators in an intuitive Python-native way.
  * Introduce a novel graph evaluator method proving fine-grained metrics.
